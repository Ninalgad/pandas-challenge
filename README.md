# PyCity Schools Analysis
## Summary
In this notebook, we compute statistics regarding
  - passing rate in math
  - passing rate in reading
  - overall passing rate
  - the budget
   <br>

  where we break down these statistics across the entire district, school size, and school type. Moreover, we compute the average math and reading scores for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school, and we rank schools based on passing rates.

## Conclusions
  - Large schools (2000-5000 students) have lower math and reading scores on average and lower passing rates overall than medium-sized (1000-2000) and small (less than 1000) schools.
  - The overall passing rate for students in schools with the highest spending ranges per student (645-680 dollars) have the poorest overall passing rates (53.52%) in comparison to students in schools with lower spending rates per student. Indeed, schools with the lowest spending rates (less than 585 dollars per student) have the highest average math and reading scores and overall passing rates.
